# Livia Lima Dot Files

These are some of the config files to set up a system the way I like it. 

I am running [Fedora 34](https://getfedora.org/) with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), [urxvt](https://addy-dclxvi.github.io/post/configuring-urxvt/), [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with [a few plugins](https://vimawesome.com/).

No features for you to fork and install the dotfiles yet, but I will eventually work on it.
